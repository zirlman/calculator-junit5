# Calculator

This repo demonstrates [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) usage together with [Hamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest) assertions.  
Unit tests are done on `Calculator` & `CalculatorAdvanced` classes to test their functionality.  
Goal of this mini project was to get familiar with Unit tests and to acomplish full test coverage.
